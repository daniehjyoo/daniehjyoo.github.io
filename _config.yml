          I was part of a team that collaborated on a <mark>Full Stack Development</mark> project, with the goal of creating a website from scratch. 
          My main focus was on the back-end, where I worked with GO to develop and maintain the website's functionality. 
          In particular, I learned how to manage the project's database using PostgreSQL. 
          To deploy and maintain the website, we used a Docker container hosted on an EC2 instance on AWS. 
          Through this project, I gained valuable experience in collaborative development, Full Stack Development, and managing databases. 
          I'm proud to include this project in my portfolio as a testament to my technical skills and ability to work effectively in a team.

          I developed a Windows programmer calculator using Java, gaining valuable experience in programming and GUI development.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          I utilized Java to develop a Windows programmer calculator that replicated the functionality of a Windows calculator with standard, scientific, and programmer modes. 
          Throughout the project, I demonstrated proficiency in refactoring non-data classes for improved program organization and maintainability. 
          To enhance the user experience, I utilized event listeners to enable real-time updates for all calculations on the GUI. 
          Through this project, I gained valuable experience in programming, GUI development, and implementing real-time updates. 
          I am excited to showcase this project as evidence of my technical skills and ability to develop efficient, user-friendly applications.

          Built a live chatbot in Java using APIs to provide real-time weather reports and top songs information, gaining valuable experience in programming and data manipulation.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          I developed a live chatbot using Java that was capable of answering user questions related to global and local weather reports and top songs. 
          By utilizing Last.fm and OpenWeather APIs, I provided real-time data-retrieval and gained experience in parsing and manipulating raw JSON data for use in edited tables. 
          Through this project, I gained valuable experience in working with APIs, developing a chatbot, and manipulating data to improve the user experience.
